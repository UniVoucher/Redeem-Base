# Redeem Base

A minimal, secure, open-source web app for gasless UniVoucher gift card redemption, integrated with the UniVoucher Partner Program.

## Features

- **Gasless Redemption**: Users redeem UniVoucher gift cards without connecting a wallet or paying gas fees
- **Partner Integration**: Integrated with UniVoucher Partner Program to earn 1% fees from redemptions
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Supports all UniVoucher-supported networks (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, BNB Chain, Avalanche)
- **Secure**: Uses proper cryptographic verification without storing sensitive data
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches live card information from UniVoucher API
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with step-by-step redemption flow

## How It Works

1. **Card Verification**: Users enter card ID and secret
2. **Secret Validation**: Server decrypts private key to verify secret ownership
3. **Gasless Redemption**: Service wallet pays gas fees and executes redemption
4. **Partner Fee**: Earns 1% partner fee from each redemption
5. **Fund Transfer**: Remaining 99% goes to recipient address

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with your actual values:

```env
# Alchemy API Key for blockchain RPC connections
ALCHEMY_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key_here

# Your UniVoucher Partner Program wallet address (receives 1% fees)
PARTNER_ADDRESS=0x_your_partner_wallet_address_here

# Private key for the service wallet (pays gas fees for gasless redemptions)
# WARNING: Keep this secure and never share it publicly
SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_service_wallet_private_key_here

# Optional: Server port (default: 3000)
PORT=3000
```

**⚠️ Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` file already excludes it.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd redeem-base
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file with your actual values
# See "Environment Variables" section above for required values
touch .env
# Edit .env with your actual keys and addresses
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
